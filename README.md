# MiniProj1
## INSRUCTIONS
1.) Each student should read the resources shared to consolidate their knowledge of creating HTML sites, and learn how to develop an SPA using any framework: VueJS or AngularJS.

2.) Each student must present a prototype that simulates the appearance and functionality of the web product, as documentation of the project. In this case, the type of prototyping to use is the wireframe, where all the pages to be developed must be presented.

3.) Each student must develop the SPA file, using a framework: VueJS or AngularJS with the requirements presented.

4.) All the files developed must be submitted to the Git platform, where each student must create an individual account. The project on Git should be called MiniProj1. The project will be assessed using the files in Git.

5.) All the files produced must also be uploaded to "Task 2.2 Submission", along with a file indicating the link to the Git project created for this purpose.

6.) You must contribute to the debate in general by commenting and giving your opinion (in a sustained manner, as in the previous points) on your colleagues' interventions, and by supporting your colleagues in resolving their doubts, using the task forum for this purpose.
